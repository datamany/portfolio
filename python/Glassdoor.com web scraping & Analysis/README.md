The idea of the project is to analyze job posts that relate to the 'DATA' field and to find out the knowledge about tools recruiters are expecting to have from potential candidates. For example, in the Business Intelligence industry there several popular instruments to utilize such as QlikView, QlikSense, PowerBI, Tableau, Looker and etc. So the question would be which of these are most popular in terms labor market demand and which are least?

The report might help to job seekers looking for the opportunity in the Data field to identify the key skills that they should concentrate on and hence to increase the level of match between recruitment demand and qualified workforce.

The following research was conducted together with one of the largest recruiting platforms in the world known as Glassdoor.com that has allowed to use open-sourced data from their platform. Up to date, it had around 12 million job listings and 1 million employers. 

The data sample is the job posts that had been published on Glassdoor.com, related to the 'Data' field and had been allocated in the top 25 best cities to work (source: https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Cities-for-Jobs-LST_KQ0,20.htm). The data was collected through the web scrapping method from 14-17 of October 2019. 

Currently, the research is on the analysis stage, however, the data was gathered already and web scraping tool could be found in this folder.
